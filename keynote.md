<aside class="notes">
  Hello, my name is Subtirelu Mihail, I am a frontend developer at Metrosystems and togheter with my coleague Adrian Staniloiu we will try to show you a new and maybe better alternative to REST APIs.

  1. First question: How many people here have worked or work with Javascript ?<br/>
      No > Yes: Wow, a lot of you didn't work with Javascript, Oh well, I am sorry for you guys but the examples in this presentation are written in JS. I am sure you will understand what we try to explain :)<br />

  2. Second question: How many of you know what a REST API is ? <br />
      No > Yes: Ok, so basically a REST API defines a set of functions which you can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST.
